    "When performing supervised machine learning analysis, it is common to withhold a portion of the data to test the final model's performance. This model testing is performed on the 'unseen' data, which the model was not trained on. This withholding of a portion of the dataset for testing is called Cross-Validation. Cross-Validation can also be used to select hyper-parameters and test the final model. In this section, we will will focus on the test data only.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-Validation also helps avoid over-fitting; a complex model could repeat the labels of the samples that it has just seen and, therefore, would have a perfect score but would fail to predict anything useful on the 'unseen' data. Furthermore, a complex model could just be modeling noise.\n"
