---How regularisation works---
    || Analytic view
        - increasing L1/L2 penalties forces coefficients to be smaller, restricting their plausible range
        - a smaller range for coefficients must be simpler/lower variance than a function with an infinite possible coefficient
          range
        - when we eliminate features, we are practically eliminating variance, as there are many more solutions available for
          models with more features, than models with less
        - when shrinking coefficients, the y-varaible will change much less when a feature changes

    || Geometric view
        - under the geometric formulation, the cost function minimum is found at the intersection of the penalty boundary (penalty
          from each of the coefficients and a contour of the traditional OLS cost function surface
