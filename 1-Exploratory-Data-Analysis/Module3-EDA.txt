---Introduction---
    || Definitions:         EDA is an approach to analysing datasets to summarise their characteristics, often using visual methods
    
    || Use:                 
        - EDA allows us to get an initial feel for the data
        - This allows us to see if the data makes sense, or if further cleaning/more data is required
        - EDA helps identify patterns or trends in the data (just as important as findings from modelling)

    || Tools
        - Data wrangling - use pandas
        - Visualisations - use matplotlib or seaborn (plotly is better I think)

------------------



---Sampling---
    || Random Sample
        - For large datasets, a random sample can make computation easier
        - We may want to fist train models on a random sample and then move onto larger set
        - In pandas we can do this using .sample():
            sample = data.sample(n=5, replace = False) # if replace=True then the same row could show up more than once


    || Stratified Sample
        - We may want to change sampling of certain observations if outcomes are uneven
        - This can make the sample become indicative of the relativeproportions of the data

---Techniques---
    || Summary statistics:
        - averag
        - median
        - min/max
        - correlations
    
    || Visualisations:
        - Histograms - to see distribution
        - Scatter plots - to see correlations/relationship between columns
        - Box plots - look at distribution and identify outliers

    
---Visualisations---
    || matplotlib
        - the main library used to create plots and graphs in python
        - a lot of flexibilities with many features you can tweak and change
        - creating plots:
            import matplotlib.pyplot as platforms
            plt.plot(data.sepal_length,
                data.sepal_width,
                ls = "",
                marker = "o",
                label = "sepal"
            )
            
            plt.plot(data.petal_length,
                data.petal_width,
                ls = "",
                marker = "o",
                label = "petal"
            )
            plt.legend
            # code above will create two overlayed plots with different auto-assigned colours and a legend

        - customising plots
            fig, ax = plt.subplots()
            ax.barh(                        # horizontal bar plot
                np.arrange(10),
                data.sepal_width.iloc[:10]
            )
            ax.set_yticks(np.arrange(0.4, 10.4, 1.0))
            ax.set_yticklabels(np.arrange(1,11))
            ax.set(xlabel="xlabel", ylabel="ylabel", title="Title")

    || pandas (via matplotlib)
    
    || seaborn
        - built on top of matplotlib
        - made to create pretty plots
        - statistically foxcused plotting methods (linear model/pairwise correlation/etc)

--------------------



---Grouping data for EDA---
    || Pandas dataframe approach
        - using groupby object
            data.groupby("species").mean().plot(
                colour=["red", "blue", "black", "green"],
                fontsize=10.0,
                figsize=(4,4)
            )
        - this would create graph with species on the x axis and multple lines for mean of each feature my species on the y

    || Seaborn plot
        - use pairplot to find feature correlations
            sns.pairplot(
                data,
                hue="species",
                size=3
            )
        - creates a grid of scatterplots between each feature and all the others
        - use seaborn hexbin plot to show density of points:
            sns.jointplot(
                x=data["sepal_length"],
                y=data["sepal_width"],
                kind="hex"
            )
        - creates a scatterplot kind of graph with hexagons being darker to signify more points in that region
        - use seaborn facet grid to see across different categories:
            # first plot statement
            plot = sns.FacetGrid(
                        data,
                        col="species"
                        margin_titles=True
                    )
            plot.map(
                plt.hist,
                "sepal_width"
                colour="green"
            )
            # second plot statement
            plot = sns.FacetGrid(
                        data,
                        col="species"
                        margin_titles=True
                    )
            plot.map(
                plt.hist,
                "sepal_length"
                colour="blue"
            )
        - this will create a grid of histogram for every species and its features, so one for setosa sepal width, etc...
