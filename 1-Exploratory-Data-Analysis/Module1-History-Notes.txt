---Definitions---
    || AI:                  a program that can sense, reason, act and adapt


    || Machine learning:    the study and construction of programs that are not explicitly progammed, but that learn patterns as 
                            they are exposed to more data over time

                            eg. emails labelled spam or not spam are fed into a machine learning algorithm that then will be able
                            to label new emails in the future as spam or not spam (more training data, better classification)
                                
        - Terminology:          features - are attributes of the data (eg. in flower classification petal length width etc)
                                target - column to be predicted (eg. in flower classification species)

        - Types of learning:    supervised learning - dataset HAS a target column, goal is to make predictions
                                unsupervised learning - does NOT have a target column, goal is to find structure in the data

        - Limitations of ML:    image classification - would be working with a huge number of featuers, and if each pixel was a
                                                       feature, the spacial relationships of pixels would be lost
 

    || Deep learning:       subset of machine learning that uses complicated models called "deep neural networks", models determine 
                            best represenatation of origional data

                            called deep learning as we are able to create models with much deeper (many more) layers

        - Benefit:              consits of a neural network that can combine feature detection and classifcation into a series of
                                layers which will eventually be able to classify an image

                                can be useful with huge amounts of complex data that has too many features to use ML flower
        
        - Caution:              there are some situations in which ML can still perform better that DL when dealing with smaller,
                                more strucured datasets, simpler datasets or when interpretability is crucial

        - History:              2014 - computer vision algorithm that can describe photos
                                2015 - deep learning platform tensorflow is developed
                                2019 - tensorflow incorporates keras which makes it more powerful

---AI Landscape today---
    || Computer vision:     self driving cars with object detection, and healthcare can give improved diagnosis
    || Natural language:    vast improvements in ability to translate, evaluate sentiment and even write papers
    
    This era of AI is different as we now have bigger datasets, faster computers and also have the abilities of neural networks

    Machine learning algorithms are being used in virtually every areas of the modern world
------------------------



---Applications---
    || Transporation:       algorithms for google and waze process traffic data to find the optimal route from one point to another
                            ride sharing for uber predicts real time demand using AI techniques

    || Social media:        use algorithms to decide what content to suggest to users based on a history of interaction
                            use sentiment analysis to categorise media and allow the appropriate "mood" to be presented

    || Daily life:          siri on our phones that can recognise our voice and do tasks
                            object detection/facial recognition on phones than can categorise who is in which photo automatically

---Machine learning workflow---
    || Steps
        - Problem statement:   what are you trying to solve
        - Data collection:     what data do you need to solve it
        - Data exploration
          & preprocessing:     how should you clean your data so you model can use it
        - Modeling:            build a model to solve the problem
        - Validation:          did you solve the problem (normally part of your training data is set aside for testing at the end)


    || Vocabulary
        - target:       value that we are trying to predict
        - features:     property of the data that will be used for prediction (explanatory variables)
        - example:      a single row within the dataset
        - label:        the value for the target variable
